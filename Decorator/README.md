## The Decorator Pattern

The Decorator design pattern is another structural pattern that allows behaviour to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behaviour of other objects from the same class. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class. The Decorator pattern is used to extend (decorate) the functionality of a certain object at run-time, independently of other instances of the same class.

The decorator pattern is typically used when there is a need to extend the functionalities of a class, and it is impractical to do so by extending it through inheritance, often because it may lead to a proliferation of subclasses.
