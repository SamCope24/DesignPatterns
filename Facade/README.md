## The Facade Pattern

The Facade design pattern is another structural pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by reducing complexity and hiding the intricate details from the user.

Essentially, the Facade pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by the client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes. This not only simplifies the client's interaction with the system but also often enhances the usability of the system itself.
