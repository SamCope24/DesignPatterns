## The Factory Pattern

The Factory Method or Factory design pattern is one of the most used design patterns. This pattern is a creational pattern, as it deals with object creation. The Factory Method Pattern suggests defining an interface (or abstract class) for creating an object but allowing the subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The main idea behind the factory method pattern is that it allows for the case where a client doesn't know what concrete classes it will be required to create at runtime, but just wants to get a class that will do the job.
